# Rubric: is this pull request ready to submit?

<!--
THIS IS THE PART YOU WRITE (fourth week running; this is the rubric's
final form in the sandbox). Your frame in SKILL.md executes whatever
checks you define here, via your procedure.md. It ships empty on
purpose: the judgment is your work.

A filled rubric must contain:

1. At least one row in the checks table. Each row needs all four
   columns:
   - Check: a short name (used in the output JSON).
   - Evidence: exactly what to look at, and where in the package. Name
     the part (the diff read against the plan's scope, the test
     evidence read against the plan's test plan, the description read
     against the diff, the repo-facts block's template asks) or a
     location from your references/evidence-guide.md. "The PR" is not
     a source; "the diff's changed files read against the plan's
     stated boundary" is.
   - Pass condition: a decision rule about the OUTCOME that someone
     else could apply and get your answer. Judge the thing itself
     (does the diff fall inside the plan plus its deviation notes? is
     the claimed evidence observable?), never the write-up's shape
     (how long the description is, how many commits there are).
     Structure-shaped checks are what make graders disagree with
     themselves.
   - Weight: `required` (a fail here holds the package) or `preferred`
     (never changes the verdict).

2. A verdict rule below the table: how the check grades combine into
   accept (submit) or reject (hold), including how `unclear` is
   treated. The verdict space is binary. State the `unclear`
   treatment explicitly: the frame here is YOUR SKILL.md, so a rubric
   that stays silent is only covered if your frame's grading
   discipline says what happens (the contract's own default is that
   an unverifiable claim fails).

Cover what actually gets bad PRs submitted. The failure families the
lecture named ARE the harness's scoring categories, same names as the
eval README: silent drift (the diff silently does more or less than
the posted plan, or the description claims fidelity the diff
contradicts), not tested (the evidence proves nothing observable, or
the repo's own checks were never run), unreviewable (debris or
unrelated hunks bury the change), and standards wall (the repo's
stated template and disclosure asks are ignored). Your evidence
guide's four headings map onto these one to one (plan fidelity =
silent drift, test evidence = not tested, diff quality =
unreviewable, standards and comms = standards wall), and the category
floor is scored on exactly these names plus clear accept. A rubric
that ignores a category will fail the eval packages built around
that category. And remember the honest-outcome
rule, fourth week running: a PR that honestly discloses a shortfall
can be ready; a rubric that equates "less than everything" with
"hold" fails the set.

## Checks

| Check | Evidence | Pass condition | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plan fidelity | The plan and its deviation notes, compared with the branch diff, issue, and draft PR description. | The diff has no unexplained changes or omissions relative to the plan. Any shortfall or deviation is disclosed in the plan and accurately described in the PR text. | required |
| Test evidence | The plan's test expectations, supplied test results, and the repository's required checks. | Relevant evidence shows the changed behavior was tested, and the repository's required checks were run successfully. Missing or inconclusive evidence fails. | required |
| Diff quality | The changed files and hunks in the branch diff, read against the issue and plan. | The changes are relevant to the issue and bounded by the plan; unrelated changes or leftover artifacts do not obstruct review. | required |
| Standards and communication | The repository's PR template and contribution policy, plus the draft title and description compared with the diff and test evidence. | The draft addresses the repository's required asks and accurately describes the change, test results, and any disclosed limitations or deviations. | required |

## Verdict rule

Accept only if every required check passes. A failed or unclear required check means reject. Preferred checks, if any are added later, do not change the verdict.
